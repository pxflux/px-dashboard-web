Accessible,without hassle of technical…. , give the viewer the possibility to perceive an artwork from a distance while giving the work an autonomous place no matter where it is shown: in a public space, a gallery or in a living room.
 

Display  ( player)

Pxflux develops new software to present very autonomos work.
The pxPlayer is a cross-platform desktop/stationery computer application whose main task is the playback of pre-recorded content as well as the real-time rendering of code-based art works.Visually, the most remarkable feature of the pxPlayer application is the absence of any user interface. The player has no buttons, no timelines, and no controls whatsoever. This is intended to remove all the destructive elements from the screen in order to give its entire space to the artwork itself. All the controls and navigational capabilities are delegated to the pxRemote app.

 
Remote 
 
The pxRemote is a mobile app that allows for user interaction and control of artwork. It is also
a browser for our library of works, as well as a communication tool for comments, reviews, and
sharing across social media networks. It is designed to work on any modern smartphone or
tablet.
The goal of separating the remote control and player is to give the viewer the possibility to
perceive an artwork from a distance while giving the work an autonomous place no matter
where it is shown: in a public space, a gallery or in a living room.
At the same time, a user can gain full control of the interactive artwork on their smartphone
without directly interfering with what is displayed on the screen.
This also enables artists to utilize all the available sensors and controlling methods of a
modern mobile device, thereby turning the remote control into a powerful instrument.
Among the traditional video formats, we currently fully support the rendering of Javascript,
WebGL, WebVR, and HTML5. Further on in the development will be support for Java
applications and frameworks like Processing and rendering of Pure-Data patches. We also
support the basic use of HTTP Live Streaming.
Our remote control and the player will provide various permission levels for the access and
control of the content. This will enable many different uses, from an exhibition visitor using
their phone to get information on the work being shown, to possibility of multiuser control of
the interactive artwork, to an owner of the player using their ‘remote control’ to get full access
to the player and the screen settings.</div></main>
